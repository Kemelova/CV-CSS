        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Nurzhan, I am 34 years old. I'm married. 
            Graduated from the Kyrgyz Economic University. 
            I chose the IT specialty because it gave me the opportunity for professional development. 
            I like working in a team, I am a sociable and purposeful person. I learn quickly, 
            I like to learn something new. My hobbies include sports, reading, traveling. 
            By the way, it is my love of travel that I often combine with work: 
            I never give up on business trips. This is probably enough for the story.</p>

        <h3>Design & Developer</h3>
        <p>I had to do HTML layout many times. In the process of work, 
            the specifications of HTML, CSS, etc. were thoroughly studied. This allowed us to avoid errors
             in the future and create correct HTML-code that strictly complies with the current standards. 
             All layout work is carried out manually without the use of auxiliary editors and other tools,
              as a result of which the code is optimal </p>
